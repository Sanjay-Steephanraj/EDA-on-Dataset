Data Profiling and Feature Engineering App
		This Streamlit application allows users to upload CSV files for data profiling and perform feature engineering transformations such as log transformation and normalization.

Features
	Upload CSV File: Users can upload a CSV file containing their dataset.
	Profile Report: Generates basic data statistics, missing value analysis, data type information, and interactive plots for numerical features.
